								<h3>Malaysia Day</h3>

								<h3>Islamic New Year</h3>
								<p> The Islamic New Year (Arabic: رأس السنة الهجرية, Raʿs as-Sanah al-Hijrīyah), also
									called the Hijri New Year, is the day that marks the beginning of a new lunar Hijri
									year,
									and is the day on which the year count is incremented. The first day of the Islamic
									year is
									observed by most Muslims on the first day of the month of Muharram. The epoch
									(reference
									date) of the Islamic era was set as the year of the emigration of Muhammad and his
									followers
									from Mecca to Medina, known as the Hijrah, which equates to 622 CE in the Gregorian
									calendar.All religious duties, such as prayer, fasting in the month of Ramadan, and
									pilgrimage, and the dates of significant events, such as celebration of holy nights
									and
									festivals, are calculated according to the Islamic calendar.

								<h3>Hari Raya Qurban(Aidiladha)/Eid al-Adha</h3>
								<p> Eid al-Adha or the Feast of Sacrifice is the second and the largest of the two main
									holidays celebrated in Islam (the other being Eid al-Fitr). It honours the
									willingness of
									Abraham to sacrifice his son, either Isaac or Ismail, as an act of obedience to
									God's
									command. However, before Abraham could sacrifice his son in the name of God, and
									because of
									his willingness to do so, God provided him with a lamb to sacrifice in his son's
									place. In
									commemoration of this intervention, animals are ritually sacrificed. Part of their
									meat is
									consumed by the family that offers the animal, while the rest of the meat is
									distributed to
									the poor and the needy. Sweets and gifts are given, and extended family members
									typically
									visit and are welcomed.The day is also sometimes called the Greater Eid.</p>

									for rest.</p>
